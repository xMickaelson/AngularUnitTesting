Prompt: so when you write unit test cases for services, you just mock them and check wether they are working or not but when you write unit test cases for components you write tests for both the components as well as the services they are calling

Yes, that's a good summary! Here's a more detailed breakdown of the approach for unit testing services versus components in Angular:

Unit Testing Services
Mocking Dependencies:

Services are often tested in isolation, meaning you can mock any dependencies they might have (like HTTP requests or other services).
This allows you to focus on testing the business logic within the service without worrying about external factors.
Verifying Behavior:

You write test cases to check if the service methods are returning the expected results.
You can use spies to check whether certain methods are called, ensuring the service behaves as intended.
Example:

If you have a CommentsService, you would mock any HTTP calls and test methods like getAllComments or postComment to ensure they handle data correctly.
Unit Testing Components
Testing Component Logic:

In component tests, you check the component's logic, including its state and how it responds to user interactions (like button clicks).
This includes verifying the component's properties and methods.
Mocking Services:

Components often depend on services to fetch or send data. These services are usually mocked in component tests.
You can check if the component interacts with the services correctly by verifying that service methods are called with the right parameters.
Template Testing:

You also test the template (HTML) associated with the component. This includes checking if the correct elements are rendered based on the component's state and user interactions.
You might simulate user actions (like typing in an input field or clicking a button) and check how the component updates the UI.
Example:

For a CommentComponent, you would test if the component displays comments correctly, calls the CommentsService to fetch or post comments, and updates the UI based on user input.
Summary
Service Tests: Focus on logic, use mocks for dependencies, and check return values and behaviors.
Component Tests: Test both logic and template behavior, mock services, and verify UI updates and user interactions.
This approach allows you to ensure both the individual services and the components that depend on them work correctly in isolation and together. If you have more specific scenarios or questions, feel free to ask!
